# Atmospheric Scattering using Rayleigh and Mie Scattering in C
---
An attempt at implementing Raleigh and Mie light scattering in C with OpenGL. In the demo you can fly around a planet (sphere) with an atmosphere simulated around it.

This project uses cmake to generate buildfiles and is currently only setup for linux packages but the CMakeLists.txt can easily be modified

Dependancies:
- libpng
- GLFW3
